The "Python Binary Calculator" GitHub repo is a Python-based console application that performs binary arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program allows users to enter two binary numbers and select the operation they want to perform on those numbers. The result is displayed in binary form, and the user can choose to continue performing additional operations or exit the program. The code is written in a modular fashion, making it easy to understand and modify. The repository includes a detailed README file with instructions on how to run the program and an explanation of the binary arithmetic operations supported by the application.
